## Abstract
In this work, a new rendering engine called **Silver** is presented in details. The full-system code was released with a sample dataset. The dataset is just meant to show the capability of the system and researchers are welcomed to generate their own datasets.
## System Requirements
To run the system smoothly on your device, the following are suggested:
* Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS.
* Unity HDRP (Unity version 2020.1.17f1).
* GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
* Vulkan API

## System Features
### Ground-truths

### Photo-realism
HDRP is based on the Scriptable Rendering Pipeline (SRP). Generally, it is intended for high visual fidelity applications. The other key feature of HDRP is the Physical Light Unit (PLU) that relies on real-life lighting measurable values. All of these attributes together contribute to the final photo-realistic rendering shown below.

### Diversity
 To avoid the over-fitting to the visual features of the synthetic world, the content of the environment is diversified by including a wide set of 3D models, textures, animations, weather conditions, illumination and lighting, and recording set-ups. Examples frames from the supported weather conditions and time of days are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:weathersAndtimeVars}.

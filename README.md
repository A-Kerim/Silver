## Abstract
In this work, a new rendering engine called **Silver** is presented in details. The full-system code was released with a sample dataset. The dataset is just meant to show the capability of the system and researchers are welcomed to generate their own datasets.
## System Requirements
To run the system smoothly on your device, the following are suggested:
* Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS.
* Unity HDRP (Unity version 2020.1.17f1).
* GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
* Vulkan API
